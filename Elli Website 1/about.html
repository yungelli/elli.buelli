        <h1>Hi, I am Elli</h1>
        <p>
            I am an aspiring automotive designer currently studying in university, with the goal of becoming an
            automotive designer. xD I have loved cars since I was a child, and I have always aspired to be part of the
            automotive industry. I have been fascinated by the shapes and the power that a car can embody. My childhood
            fascination began with an Aston Martin DB11. My aim is to see my art recognized on the streets one day and
            to contribute to the automotive industry, making it more innovative, environmentally friendly, and
            aesthetically pleasing.
